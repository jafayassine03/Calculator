Python Terminal Calculator

This is a simple calculator that runs in the terminal.
I built this project while practicing Python basics like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

The program lets you perform basic arithmetic operations and keeps running until you choose to exit.

What it can do

Add two numbers

Subtract two numbers

Multiply two numbers

Divide two numbers

Keep running in a loop so you can calculate multiple times

Handle invalid menu inputs

Exit the program cleanly

Why I made this

I created this project to practice:

while loops

if/elif conditions

Error handling with try/except

Working with user input

It’s a small project, but it helped me understand how to structure a simple CLI program.
